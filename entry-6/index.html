          <h2 class="headline center-headline">First Halloween</h2>
          <p class="copy center-copy">
            I had always imagined what a Halloween party in America would be like. Growing up in India, Halloween only existed through screens—kids in strange costumes, porches glowing orange, bowls of candy I could almost taste. It wasn’t something we celebrated, so I never got to play dress-up. The idea that I could be anyone I wanted—a princess, a pirate, a fallen angel—felt both thrilling and absurd. I used to wonder how it would feel to walk into a night that allowed that kind of freedom.

          <p class="copy center-copy">
            When I first moved to New York, I thought my first Halloween would be cinematic, like the ones in movies where everyone looks effortlessly cool under neon lights. Freshman year, I didn’t go out. I was too nervous, too uncertain, and didn’t have the kind of close friendships that make it easy to take risks. I told myself I’d try again next time, when I felt a little more like I belonged.
          </p>
          <p class="copy center-copy">
            This year, I did. My friends and I got ready in my apartment, music playing too loud, glitter everywhere, the smell of perfume and hair spray mixing with instant noodles and eyeliner wipes. The mirror reflected an odd collection of characters: Catwoman, Lara Croft, Poison Ivy, a snow leopard, a fallen angel, and two pirates. It sounded like the beginning of a bad joke or maybe a really good one. We took photos that already felt nostalgic, the kind we would laugh about later, and then braced ourselves for the cold.

            The subway was chaos. Everyone was pressed together, wings tangled with capes, fake blood smudging onto strangers’ coats. People shouted directions, trains screeched, someone started singing. Somewhere in the noise we got separated, and the crowd swallowed me whole. I could feel my anxiety climbing as the air got tighter. After a few minutes, I decided to turn back. Lara Croft came with me, both of us laughing at how anticlimactic it was.
          </p>
          <p class="copy center-copy">
            Back at my place, we peeled off our costumes, made ramen, and curled up on the couch to watch <em>The Corpse Bride</em>. Steam from the bowls fogged up the window as the city hummed outside. It wasn’t the wild Halloween I had always imagined, but it felt like the right one. Maybe next year I’ll go out again, maybe I’ll even stay out until sunrise. Or maybe I’ll just make ramen, watch a movie, and let the night be quiet in its own way. Either way, it still feels like my first real Halloween.
