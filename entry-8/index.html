            It was one of those cold weekends that feel borrowed from winter, the kind where the air bites a little and you start wishing you had worn two jackets instead of one. My sister and I decided to drive up to Cold Spring, and the trip immediately turned into a karaoke session. The last fall colors hung on in patches along the road, little smudges of orange and gold beside whole stretches of trees that looked dried out and ready to quit. We pointed them out like they were rare sightings.

            Cold Spring felt small and sweet, almost like a movie set pretending to be a town. We found a lake and sat there for a while, talking in that unhurried way that only happens on weekends. At one point a man drove by with a giant teddy bear strapped to the roof of his bright red car. He was clearly trying to impress his girlfriend. She covered her face. We tried very hard not to burst out laughing.

            A free fudge tasting pulled us inside a little shop, and we sampled everything like we had actual authority. We walked out with a block of pumpkin maple white chocolate fudge that tasted like the last possible moment of fall. A few steps later we found a vintage junk store that felt like a treasure hunt. Beautiful ceramics, soft scarves in strange colors, retro lamps glowing in corners, stacks of posters, books that smelled old in a good way, and endless knick knacks that made us stop every few seconds. We wandered around until it got dark, which in December means basically five in the afternoon.

            We asked the owner for dinner recommendations and ended up in a tiny Italian place nearby. The sourdough arrived warm enough to fog my glasses a little, and the ravioli was comforting in that calm, quiet way pasta can be. Dessert was a heavy apple crumble cake covered in caramel sauce, and we pretended we would only take a few bites, which was obviously a lie.

          <p class="copy center-copy">
            On the drive back we played Bollywood sad songs at full volume and screamed along like we were auditioning for a very dramatic music video. It was the kind of day that did not need a lesson or deeper meaning. It just felt good to be cold and full and slightly ridiculous with someone who knows me better than almost anyone.
