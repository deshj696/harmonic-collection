      <p>
        I have always been fascinated by the feeling of in-betweenness, that strange space between being settled and still searching. This project is an archive of my weekends during sophomore year, a time when I am no longer new to New York but not quite at home in it either. It is about the ordinary rituals that make a life feel like yours: late dinners with friends, subway rides that blur into thought, and the small satisfaction of doing nothing in a city that demands everything. These weekends became my way of learning the city, not through landmarks or lists, but through repetition, warmth, and the slow rhythm of growing up.
      </p>

      <p>
        I think about <em>Frances Ha</em>, a film where not much seems to happen, yet everything does. Friendship, ambition, loneliness, love, and the awkward choreography of figuring out who you are. That is the tone I wanted to capture here. Each entry holds a moment that might seem small, but together they trace a quiet transformation. I am not documenting milestones; I am recording what it feels like to live between them.
      </p>

      <p>
        You are invited to move through these fragments: photographs, playlists, and reflections that form a record of a year spent learning how to see beauty in the mundane. Some weekends were chaotic, others calm, but all of them felt like proof that I was here, trying. This archive is not about where I went, but about how I stayed, and how I began to find the city while it slowly began to find me.
