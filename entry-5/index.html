              <p class="copy">sunday started slow. i woke up still thinking about the sunset i saw at pebble beach in dumbo the evening before. that spot always feels like a pause button. it’s quiet, soft, and makes me forget how loud the city can be. on saturday, i stopped by foot locker for some retail therapy and finally got the burgundy sneakers i wanted. they made me happy. i spent the night in brooklyn listening to my playlist that carried into sunday. by the afternoon, i had them on my feet, walking through central park with no real plan, just letting the day move at its own pace.</p>

              <p class="copy">the air was cold and cloudy when i walked through sheep meadow. i had an iced banana bread latte in my hand, even though it felt more like a tea day. i found a bench near bethesda fountain and sat there for a while. two ducks were splashing in the pond, chasing each other, and for a moment it looked like they were in love. then a couple in a boat drifted into view, dressed for a wedding shoot. both the ducks and the couple shared the same scene for a second, and it felt like a small coincidence that meant something. a quiet reminder that love finds its way around us all the time.</p>

              <p class="copy">it was my dad’s birthday a few days ago, but he was away on a work trip. when he got back, me and my sister took our parents out for dinner and brought him a small cake. we went to a korean restaurant called take 31 that had really good food. the seafood udon was perfect, they gave us tteokbokki, and the corn cheese pancake was unreal. baba, that’s what i call my dad, looked happy the whole time. we talked, laughed, and watched him enjoy every bite. it was simple, and it felt right.</p>
