              <p class="copy">my friend flew home for a quick break and came back with treasure. old nintendo switches, game carts that click in with the most satisfying sound, and a plan that only a rainy night can birth. mario party. i had never played before and they laughed at the way i held the switch like it was a camera. we grabbed a hot pizza from little caeser’s and a few beers on the way. that pizza for nights like this is so slept on. the box steamed up the room, controllers on the coffee table, and suddenly it felt like being ten again.</p>

              <p class="copy">i locked in peach the second the game loaded. i had no idea what i was doing but i knew i wanted to be her. when daisy popped up as my ally i squealed like a five year old. at first i tried to be nice. i used my coins to move, mushrooms for a little boost, and i did not throw a coinado at anyone because i wanted to keep the peace. turns out beginner’s luck is real because i was cruising through mini games, collecting stars like it was my part time job. i kept glancing at the leaderboard and grinning like a menace.</p>

              <p class="copy">round two and we thought it was mine again. then juliana chose monty mole and the universe started winking at her. every time the star moved it decided to sit right next to her like they had plans. shops kept handing her golden pipes and mushrooms that zipped her to the front. we were screaming, laughing, bargaining, the whole thing. the final tally came up and monty mole took it, clean and easy. i sat there holding my controller with greasy pizza fingers and clapped because honestly it was iconic.</p>
