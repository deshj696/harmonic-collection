        <h2 class="headline">she’s a regular at <span class="accent">Steam</span></h2>
        <p class="copy">It was in late March of freshman year that me and my friends found Steam, this little Chinese place tucked away between a laundromat and a wine store, just outside the Lang building. We haven’t stopped going there since. I love bringing people there and having them exclaim at the prices, comparing the taste to Din Tai Fung. They give you free Jasmine tea and fortune cookies that all have the same chit of paper. Something about that place pulls me in every time.</p>

      <article class="story" id="met">
        <h2 class="headline">metropolitan museum of art</h2>
        <p class="copy">The best part of living in New York City is that I’m just a subway ride away from the MET. I love going there alone, putting on my playlist and wandering among the halls decked with beautiful art. It never gets old and I always end up finding something I’ve never seen before, like this sparkly crystal deer.</p>

      <article class="story" id="doggo">
        <h2 class="headline">met the cutest doggo</h2>
        <p class="copy">She was the cutest golden retriever, waddling her feet towards mine at the MET steps. The owner was the sweetest and he let me pet her. She tried to lick my hands, maybe because they were salty from the pretzel I was eating but I wasn’t complaining.</p>
